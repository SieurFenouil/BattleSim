# Auto Battler Game - Development Roadmap

## Project Vision üéØ
Build a console-based auto battler game with automated combat mechanics and unit progression, designed for eventual transition to a web-based version. Focus on solid core mechanics and modular architecture.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation ‚ö° 
**Status: In Progress** | **Target: Week 1-2**

### Combat Engine
- [x] Speed-based turn system implementation
- [x] Team vs team battle mechanics  
- [x] Basic attack and damage system
- [ ] Combat logging and battle visualization
- [ ] Advanced combat actions (dodge, parry, combo)
- [ ] Status effects framework

### Unit System
- [x] Fighter template with random stat generation
- [x] Combat entity wrapper for battle state
- [ ] Unit balance testing and refinement
- [ ] Multiple unit types/classes
- [ ] Unit progression mechanics

### Integration & Testing
- [ ] Main game loop connecting all systems
- [ ] Sample battle scenarios for testing
- [ ] Error handling and edge case coverage
- [ ] Performance optimization for larger battles

## Phase 2: Gameplay Depth üéÆ
**Status: Planned** | **Target: Week 3-4**

### Progression Systems
- [ ] Experience and leveling mechanics
- [ ] Skill trees and specializations  
- [ ] Equipment and gear system
- [ ] Unit recruitment and roster management

### Game Modes
- [ ] Tournament bracket system
- [ ] Campaign progression
- [ ] Challenge battles with modifiers
- [ ] Leaderboard and scoring system

### AI & Strategy
- [ ] Team composition algorithms
- [ ] Strategic formation positioning
- [ ] Adaptive AI difficulty scaling
- [ ] Battle prediction and analysis

## Phase 3: Polish & Features üåü
**Status: Future** | **Target: Week 5-6**

### User Experience
- [ ] Rich console interface with colors and formatting
- [ ] Battle replay system
- [ ] Statistics tracking and analytics
- [ ] Save/load functionality with file persistence

### Content Expansion
- [ ] Multiple environments/arenas with unique mechanics
- [ ] Special events and limited-time challenges
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Narrative elements and lore

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Balance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Code documentation and cleanup

## Phase 4: Web Transition Planning üåê
**Status: Research** | **Target: Future**

### Architecture Design
- [ ] Web framework selection (Flask/Django vs React/Vue)
- [ ] Real-time battle visualization design
- [ ] Database schema for user accounts and game state
- [ ] API design for game mechanics

### Feature Adaptation
- [ ] Convert console interface to web UI
- [ ] Implement real-time battle animations
- [ ] Add multiplayer capabilities
- [ ] Social features (friends, guilds, chat)

### Deployment & Scaling
- [ ] Cloud hosting setup and configuration
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] User authentication and security
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

## Technical Milestones üõ†Ô∏è

### Current Sprint Goals
1. **Complete Phase 1 core systems** - Solid combat and unit mechanics
2. **Integration testing** - Ensure all components work together seamlessly  
3. **Performance baseline** - Establish benchmarks for future optimization

### Key Decision Points
- **Unit balance**: Finalize stat ranges and progression curves
- **Combat complexity**: Determine optimal number of actions/mechanics
- **Web timing**: When to start web transition planning

### Success Metrics
- **Stability**: Zero crashes during extended play sessions
- **Balance**: No single strategy dominates all others  
- **Performance**: Battles complete in reasonable time even with many units
- **Modularity**: Easy to add new features without major refactoring

## Dependencies & Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Technical Dependencies
- Pure Python standard library (no external dependencies)
- Console environment with ANSI color support
- File system access for save/load functionality

### Development Risks
- **Scope creep**: Keep focused on core mechanics before adding features
- **Balance complexity**: Avoid over-engineering simple systems
- **Web transition**: Maintain modular design for easier porting

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular testing and user feedback collection
- Incremental development with working prototypes at each stage
- Clear separation of concerns in code architecture
- Documentation of design decisions and trade-offs
