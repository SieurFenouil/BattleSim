# Auto Battler Game - TODO List

## Current Sprint 🎯

### Combat System
- [ ] Test arena.py combat flow with sample battles
- [ ] Add battle logging/output to see what's happening
- [ ] Handle edge case: empty target_list when no enemies alive
- [ ] Add more combat actions beyond basic attack (parry, dodge, block, combo, retaliate)

### Unit System
- [ ] Test barracks.py unit creation with different stat distributions
- [ ] Balance stat ranges and scaling
- [ ] Add unit types/classes beyond basic fighter template

### Integration

- [ ] Battle statistics tracking

## Future Enhancements 🚀

### Advanced Combat
- [ ] Status effects (poison, stun, buffs)
- [ ] Critical hits and damage variance
- [ ] Elemental damage types
- [ ] Formation positioning effects

### Progression Systems
- [ ] Equipment and gear system

## Completed ✅
- ✅ Set up development environment with utils folder
- ✅ Created barracks.py with FighterTemplate and random stats
- ✅ Built arena.py with speed-based combat system
- ✅ Fixed combat entity initialization and speed meter logic
- ✅ Implemented team management and battle cleanup
- ✅ Applied Python naming conventions throughout codebase

## Notes 📝
- Keep modular design for easy web transition later
- Focus on core mechanics before adding complexity
- Test each system thoroughly before integration
- Remember: user handles all implementation, agent provides reviews only
